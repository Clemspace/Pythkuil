# New Ithkuil Language Toolkit

This project is a Python-based toolkit for working with the New Ithkuil language, a highly sophisticated constructed language designed for precise and unambiguous communication. This toolkit is specifically related to Ithkuil III, the latest version of the language.

## Roadmap

1. Implement core functionality:
   - Fill in the TODO sections in each file, especially in the morphology files.
   - Implement the generate() and parse() methods in the Formative class.
   - Develop the logic for case accessors and case stacking in the CaseSystem class.

2. Create utility functions:
   - Implement functions for handling vowel sequences and consonant forms.
   - Create functions for applying and interpreting morphophonological rules.

3. Develop a lexicon system:
   - Create a database or structured file to store New Ithkuil roots and their meanings. 
   - Implement functions to lookup and retrieve roots and their associated stems.

4. Build parsing and generation pipelines:
   - Create a system to take a New Ithkuil word and break it down into its constituent morphological parts.
   - Develop a reverse process to take morphological information and construct a valid New Ithkuil word.

5. Implement higher-level grammar rules:
   - Develop classes and functions to handle sentence structure and syntax.
   - Implement logic for handling complex grammatical constructions like case-frames.

6. Create a translation system:
   - Develop a basic framework for translating between New Ithkuil and another language (like English).
   - Implement rules for handling the semantic nuances of New Ithkuil in translation.

7. Develop corpus generation tools:
   - Create functions to generate valid New Ithkuil words and sentences based on your implemented rules.
   - Implement variety and randomness in generation to create a diverse corpus.

8. Build a testing framework:
   - Develop unit tests for each component of your system.
   - Create integration tests to ensure different parts of the system work together correctly.
   - Implement a way to validate generated New Ithkuil against the grammar rules.

9. Create a user interface:
   - Develop a command-line interface for interacting with your tools.
   - Creating a simple web interface for broader accessibility.

10. Documentation and refinement:
    - Write comprehensive documentation for the codebase and how to use the tools.
    - Continually refine and optimize for more complex functionality.
