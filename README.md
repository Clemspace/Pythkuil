   - Tokenization

2. **Grammar**: Defines the grammatical structures of Ithkuil.
   - Case system
   - Parsers for various word types (formatives, adjuncts, numericals, etc.)
   - Word type definitions

3. **Lexicon**: Manages the Ithkuil lexicon.
   - Root and affix definitions
   - PDF parsing for lexicon extraction
   - Root database management

4. **Morphology**: Implements the morphological rules of Ithkuil.
   - Affiliation, Configuration, Essence, Extension, Perspective
   - CA complex handling
   - Phonological rules
   - Slot parsing and generation for formatives

5. **Utils**: Provides utility functions for various tasks.
   - Character classification
   - PDF parsing
   - Shortcut handling
   - Validation

6. **Tests**: Contains unit tests for various components.
